# Stock Finder

Introducing a investment aid tool that harnesses the power of
cutting-edge research, media sentiment, and stock market performance to iden-
tify potentially undervalued opportunities in industries with substantial research
output. By tapping into arXiv’s database, the tool identifies industries with the
highest number of research publications in a user-specified time frame, signifying
sectors on the verge of innovation and growth. This industry becomes the focal
point for sentiment analysis through Marketaux, capturing media sentiment on
companies within the industry. Leveraging Yahoo Finance data, the tool then
cross-references stock performances, pinpointing companies that, while riding
high on positive media sentiment, haven’t yet experienced significant stock ap-
preciation. This seamless integration offers users a curated list of companies
positioned in high-research industries, enjoying favorable media outlook, yet
potentially undervalued in the stock market. Hosted on AWS’s reliable EC2
platform and featuring a user-friendly React front-end and a backend built with
node, this tool bridges the gap between academia, media, and financial markets,
presenting an invaluable asset for long-term investors seeking untapped growth
potential or short-term investors looking for over hyped companies which have
not yet seen corrections in their share price.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
